3. Write a query to display the fields - restaurant_id, name, borough, and cuisine - for all documents.
4. Write a query to display the fields - restaurant_id, name, borough, and cuisine - but do not show the field _id for all documents.
5. Write a query to show all restaurants in the Bronx borough.
6. Write a query to show restaurants with a score between 80 and 100 (data may need to be aggregated).
